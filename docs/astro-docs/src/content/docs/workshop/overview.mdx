## About the sample application

During the activities of this workshop you will be using the **sample generative AI agent** application that was deployed during the environment setup.

This **realistic hotel booking agent** is built on top of [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/), and its capable of intelligent decision-making. The agent uses an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts) that exposes tools to communicate with mocked external APIs, allowing it to:

- **Understand user requests** - Process natural language like *"Find me a luxury hotel near the beach in Miami for next weekend"*
- **Make intelligent decisions** - Determine which tools to use and how to orchestrate multiple operations
- **Coordinate API calls** - Use the MCP server to interact with Property Resolution, Reservations, and Toxicity Detection services
- **Provide intelligent responses** - Synthesize information from multiple sources into helpful user responses

The MCP server acts as a bridge between the agent and the backend hotel booking APIs, enabling seamless integration and intelligent automation.

### External Mocked APIs

The application also has three mock APIs that simulate a production hotel platform:

**Property Resolution Service**

- Handles natural language hotel searches ("find me a luxury hotel near the beach")
- Uses Amazon Location Service for dynamic hotel discovery
- Returns ranked results across major hotel brands (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, etc.)

**Reservation Services**

- Complete booking management (create, modify, cancel reservations)
- Guest information and payment processing
- Room availability and pricing queries

**Toxicity Detection Service**

- Content moderation for user reviews and interactions
- Multi-category analysis (threats, insults, hate speech, obscenity)
- Automated escalation when human intervention is needed

## Workshop Activities

The workshop is organized into **progressive sections**, each designed to help you develop your AI-Assisted software development skills.

Each workshop section includes:
- **Core activities** that you should definitely consider trying
- **AWS MCP server activities** to experience different ways to leverage these AI tools for an enhanced experience
- **Extra Challenges** if you want to dive deeper

<Aside type="note" title="Flexible approach">
Please note that you **don't have to complete every activity** in each section, you can **pick and choose** based on your interests and available time.
