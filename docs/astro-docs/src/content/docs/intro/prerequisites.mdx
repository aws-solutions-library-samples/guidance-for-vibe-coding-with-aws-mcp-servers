</Steps>

### Step 2: Install Required Software Development Tools

<Steps>

1. **Install Node and Python**

    Install the latest LTS version of NodeJS, or at least v20.18.1. We recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it.

    Make sure you have python 3.12+ installed. Use your preferred installation method, such as from the [official python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/), or other package managers.

    **Verify installation:**

    ```bash title="Verifying Node and Python"
    # Ensure Node.js v20.18.1+ is installed
    node --version

    # Ensure Python v3.12+ is installed
    python --version
    ```

2. **Install uv (Python package manager)**

   **Install uv**: Visit [https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and select your operating system for installation instructions.

   ```bash title="Verifying uv installation"
   # Verify installation
   uv --version
   ```

3. **Install pnpm (Node.js Package Manager)**

   Visit the official [installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation), follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

   **Verify installation:**

   ```bash title="Verifying pnpm installation"
   pnpm --version
   ```
4. **Install Docker or Rancher Desktop**

   Choose one container runtime:

   - **Option A:** Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
   - **Option B:** Download and install [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)

   ```bash title="Verifying container runtime installation"
   # Verify installation
   docker --version
   ```

5. **Install Graphviz**
    Visit the [graphviz download site](https://graphviz.org/download/) for instructions.

6. **Install AWS CLI**

   Install the AWS CLI following the [official installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for your operating system.

   ```bash title="Verifying AWS CLI installation"
   # Verify installation and configure
   aws --version
   aws configure list
   ```

7. **Install CDK CLI**

   ```bash title="Installing AWS CDK CLI"
   # Install AWS CDK CLI globally using pnpm
   pnpm add -g aws-cdk

1. **Install Bruno CLI (for API testing)**

   ```bash title="Installing Bruno CLI"
   # Install Bruno CLI
   npm install -g @usebruno/cli
   ```

</Steps>

## Verification Commands

Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash title="Verifying setup"
echo "=== Development Tools ==="
pnpm --version 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ pnpm not found"
node --version 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ Node.js not found"
python --version 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ Python not found"
aws --version 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ AWS CLI not found"
uv --version 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ uv not found (required for MCP servers)"

echo "=== Recommended Tools (Optional) ==="
bru --version 2>/dev/null || echo "ℹ️ Bruno CLI not installed (optional - needed for API testing)"

# Check AWS access and project setup
echo "=== AWS Access ==="
aws sts get-caller-identity 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ AWS credentials not configured"
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during setup:

1. Review common issues in our [Troubleshooting Guide](/faq/troubleshooting/)
2. Request technical support through the designated Slack channel
3. Arrive a few minutes early to the workshop session for last-minute setup assistance

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Test your complete setup by running through the verification checklist at
  least 24 hours before the workshop. This gives you time to resolve any issues without
  rushing.
