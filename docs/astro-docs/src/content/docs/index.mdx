## Welcome!

Confucius once said: ***"I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."*** , that is why during this workshop, we foster a learn-by-doing approach. The workshop presents useful AI-assisted software development techniques to effectively use coding assistants to create and modify code via interactive prompts (a.k.a. "vibe coding"). You will discover, analyze, and enhance an existing application that consists of a realistic hotel booking GenAI assistant.

You will learn how to use development environments like **[Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)** or **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** along with coding assistants like **[Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/)** or **[Cline](https://cline.bot/)**, and the **[AWS Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/)** to work on real development tasks while learning workflows that accelerate understanding and implementation.

Behind the scenes, you will learn about about **[Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html)** for Foundation Model (FM) access along with using the **[AWS Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp)** for improved coding assistant performance. You will also experiment with modifying Infrastructure as Code (IaC) components built using the **[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)**, open-source **[Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/)** framework, and **[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore]("https://https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore)**.

Whether you're an AWS professional, developer, or technical leader, you'll learn practical skills for leveraging AI tools in your development workflow and gain knowledge that you can share with your teams and customers.

The techniques you'll learn cover:

- **Application Discovery** - to help you understand complex systems quickly
- **Intelligent Code Generation** - to write, enhance, and debug code efficiently
- **Enhanced Problem Solving** - to perform architecture analysis, optimization, and testing
- **Rapid Prototyping** - to quickly iterate on ideas

## About your Development Environment

[Setup your own development environment](/dev-env/development-environment-setup)**, and deploy the sample application in your own AWS account. This ensures that by the end on the workshop you'll have your own setup fully configured and ready to be used in your own projects.
