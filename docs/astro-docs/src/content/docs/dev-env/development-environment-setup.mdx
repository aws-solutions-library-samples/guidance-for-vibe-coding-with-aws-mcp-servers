<Aside type="note" title="For Self-Deployment Users Only">
**Workshop Studio Users**: Your infrastructure is already deployed. You can **skip this entire page** and proceed directly to [Setup IDE Extensions](/dev-env/ide-extensions-setup).

**Self-Deployment Users**: Follow all steps below to deploy the AWS infrastructure to your own account.
</Aside>

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Complete Prerequisites

Before deploying the sample application, ensure you have all required tools installed. Review the detailed [Prerequisites Guide](/intro/prerequisites/) which covers:

- AI-Assisted Development Tools (Amazon Q, Cline, Kiro, etc.)
- Required Software Development Tools (Node.js, Python, uv, pnpm, Docker, AWS CLI, CDK CLI)
- Optional tools for API testing (Bruno CLI)

If you've already installed these tools, you can proceed directly to Step 2.

### Step 2: Deploy the sample agentic application

<Steps>

1. **Navigate to Workshop Directory**

    Open a terminal and navigate to the workshop repository directory:

    ```bash title="Navigating to workshop directory"
    cd guidance-for-vibe-coding-with-aws-mcp-servers
    ```

    <Aside type="tip">
      If you don't have the repository yet, you can clone or download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-vibe-coding-with-aws-mcp-servers) before continuing.
    </Aside>

2. **Install Project Dependencies**

   ```bash title="Installing project dependencies"
   # Install Node.js dependencies
   pnpm install
   ```

   <Aside type="note" title="Python environment management">
     This project uses `uv` for Python dependency management. 
     The CDK commands (via `pnpm cdk`) automatically create and manage the Python 
     virtual environment - no manual setup required!
   </Aside>

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**

   Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with appropriate permissions:

   ```bash title="Verifying AWS account access"
   # Verify AWS access
   aws sts get-caller-identity

   # Set your preferred region (if not already set), we have only tested this workshop using either us-west-2 or us-east-1 regions.
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
   ```

4. **Bootstrap CDK (if needed)**

   If this is your first time using CDK in this AWS account/region:

   ```bash title="CDK Bootstrapping" ins="AWS-ACCOUNT-NUMBER"
   # Bootstrap CDK for your account/region (replace with your actual account number)
   pnpm cdk bootstrap aws://AWS-ACCOUNT-NUMBER/us-west-2
   ```

   <Aside type="note" title="Finding your AWS account number">
     You can find your account number by running `aws sts get-caller-identity`.
   </Aside>

   <Aside type="caution" title="Troubleshooting">
     - If you see *Permission Denied* errors with your Python interpreter, try the following:
      ```bash title="Recreate uv venv"
      cd packages/cdk-infra-python
      rm -rf .venv
      uv sync
      ```
   </Aside>

5. **Deploy the Mock APIs**

   ```bash title="Deploying mock APIs"
   # Deploy all three hotel booking APIs
   pnpm cdk deploy --require-approval never VibeCodingWorkshopMockApis
   ```

   This will deploy:
   - **Property Resolution API** - Hotel search service
   - **Reservation Services API** - Booking management service
   - **Toxicity Detection API** - Content moderation service
   


6. **Retrieve API Configuration**

   After deployment, get your API URLs and keys:

   ```bash title="Getting stack outputs"
   # Get stack outputs (URLs and API key IDs)
   aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
     --stack-name VibeCodingWorkshopMockApis \
     --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[*].[OutputKey,OutputValue]' \
     --output table
   ```

7. **Deploy the AgentCore Booking Agent Stack**

   ```bash title="Deploying AgentCore Agent Stack"
   # Deploy the hotel booking agent stack
   pnpm cdk deploy --require-approval never VibeCodingWorkshopBookingAgent
   ```

   This will deploy:
   - **Hotel Booking Agent** - Intelligent agent with memory and conversation capabilities
   - **AgentCore Infrastructure** - Lambda layers, IAM roles, and shared resources needed for agents

8. **Deploy the AgentCore MCP Server Stack**

   ```bash title="Deploying AgentCore MCP Server Stack"
   # Deploy the hotel booking MCP server stack
   pnpm cdk deploy --require-approval never VibeCodingWorkshopMcpServer
   ```

   This will deploy:
   - **Hotel Booking MCP Server** - Model Context Protocol server for API integration
   - **MCP Infrastructure** - Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints for MCP communication

9. **Verify Stacks Deployment**

    ```bash title="Verifying stacks deployment"
    # Verify all stacks deployed successfully
    aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE UPDATE_COMPLETE
    ```

    You should see all three stacks in the list:
    - `VibeCodingWorkshopMockApis` - Mock hotel booking APIs
    - `VibeCodingWorkshopBookingAgent` - Hotel booking agent with AgentCore runtime
    - `VibeCodingWorkshopMcpServer` - MCP server with AgentCore runtime

    <Aside type="note" title="AgentCore Deployment">
      The `VibeCodingWorkshopBookingAgent` and `VibeCodingWorkshopMcpServer` CDK stacks automatically deploy the AgentCore runtimes. No additional deployment steps are needed.
    </Aside>

</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="Deployment Time">
  The CDK deployment typically takes 5-10 minutes. The stacks
  create Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, DynamoDB tables, AgentCore runtimes, and other AWS
  resources needed for the hotel booking system.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Troubleshooting Deployment">
  If deployment fails: 
    1. Check that you have the necessary AWS permissions for creating Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB tables, IAM
    roles, and Bedrock AgentCore resources.
    2. Review common issues in our [Troubleshooting Guide](/faq/troubleshooting/)
    3. For AgentCore-specific deployment issues, see [AgentCore Deployment Troubleshooting](/faq/troubleshooting/#agentcore-deployment-issues)

## Configuring your IDE Extensions

Once you get your development environment ready, continue by setting up your IDE extensions:
